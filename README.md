<h1>Discord Minecraft Server Status Bot<h1>
This bot uses the discord.js and minecraft-server-util packages to retrieve and display the status of a Minecraft server in a Discord channel.

Getting Started
To get started with this bot, you'll need to perform the following steps:

Clone the repository to your local machine.
Install the required dependencies by running npm install.
Open index.js in your favorite text editor and modify the SERVER_IP and CHANNEL_ID variables to match your Minecraft server IP address and the ID of the Discord channel you want to send the status message to.
Run the bot by running npm start.
Usage
Once the bot is running, it will periodically retrieve the status of the Minecraft server and post it in the specified Discord channel. The status message includes information such as the number of players currently online, the server's MOTD, and the version of Minecraft being run.
